Pretty fast disk usage analyzer written in Go.

Gdu is intended primarily for SSD disks where it can fully utilize parallel processing.
However HDDs work as well, but the performance gain is not so huge.

## Examples

    gdu                                   # analyze current dir
    gdu -a                                # show apparent size instead of disk usage
    gdu <some_dir_to_analyze>             # analyze given dir
    gdu -d                                # show all mounted disks
    gdu -l ./gdu.log <some_dir>           # write errors to log file
    gdu -i /sys,/proc /                   # ignore some paths
    gdu -I '.*[abc]+'                     # ignore paths by regular pattern
    gdu -X ignore_file /                  # ignore paths by regular patterns from file
    gdu -c /                              # use only white/gray/black colors

    gdu -n /                              # only print stats, do not start interactive mode
    gdu -np /                             # do not show progress, useful when using its output in a script
    gdu -nps /some/dir                    # show only total usage for given dir
    gdu / > file                          # write stats to file, do not start interactive mode

    gdu -o- / | gzip -c >report.json.gz   # write all info to JSON file for later analysis
    zcat report.json.gz | gdu -f-         # read analysis from file

## Modes

Gdu has three modes: interactive (default), non-interactive and export.

Non-interactive mode is started automtically when TTY is not detected (using [go-isatty](https://github.com/mattn/go-isatty)), for example if the output is being piped to a file, or it can be started explicitly by using a flag.

Export mode (flag `-o`) outputs all usage data as JSON, which can be later opened using the `-f` flag.

Hard links are counted only once.

## File flags

Files and directories may be prefixed by a one-character
flag with following meaning:

* `!` An error occurred while reading this directory.

* `.` An error occurred while reading a subdirectory, size may be not correct.

* `@` File is symlink or socket.

* `H` Same file was already counted (hard link).

* `e` Directory is empty.

## RAM usage

Gdu can consume a lot of memory - around 500-1000 MB of RAM for 1 mil files. It's a trade off for being so fast.

If you want lower memory usage and don't mind giving up some speed, you can use `--enable-gc` / `-g` flag.
It will run garbage collection during the analysis phase.
As a result, the analysis will be about 25% slower and will consume about 30% less memory.

If you need some more fine tunning, you can use the `GOGC` environment variable to set how often the garbage collection will happen.
Default value is `100`. Lower value means GC will run more often. Higher than 100 means less often. Negative number will stop GC.

Example running gdu with GC enabled, but not so aggresive as default:

```
GOGC=200 gdu -g /
```

## Running tests

    make test

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks were performed on 50G directory (100k directories, 400k files) on 500 GB SSD using [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine).
See `benchmark` target in [Makefile](Makefile) for more info.
